	Minimize a ligand
		[obminimize file.mol2]
		# note: this creates output in command window
		
		[obminimize file.sdf > file.sdf] (not working)
		# note: this saves the file with minimized energy in a file designated by the string before the ">" sign
		        not working
		
		[obminimize -o sdf foo.sdf > out.sdf] (working)
		# note: Use the -o parameter to specify the output file format and redirect the output to write the output file.
			    this saves the file with minimized energy in a file designated by the string after the ">" sign
		
	Convert all smi files in a directory to mol2 files 
		# This is for batch operations
		
		[obabel *.smi -omol2 -m] (generates funny looking compound)
		# note: "-m" paramter tells it to save it in multiple files
		
		[obabel *.smi -omol2 -m --gen3d] (working)
		[obabel *.smi -opdb -m --gen3d] (converting to pdb)
		# note: the "--gen3d" option causses openbabel to build coordinates, atoms of the compound is linked with bonds
			    might take more time to generate molecule
				
	Convert sdf to mol 2
		obabel -i sdf ligand.sdf -o mol2 -O ligand.min.mol2 [working]
				
	Calculate total energy
		[obenergy [options] file.ext]
		# just type only obenergy to learn more about options
		
		
	Convert from smi to mol2
		[obabel -ismi -omol2]
		# note: haven't tested
